<h1>xdevcfg v3_0</h1>
<p>
The is the main header file for the Device Configuration Interface of the Zynq device. The device configuration interface has three main functionality. 1. AXI-PCAP 2. Security Policy 3. XADC This current version of the driver supports only the AXI-PCAP and Security Policy blocks. There is a separate driver for XADC.<p>
AXI-PCAP is used for download/upload an encrypted or decrypted bitstream. DMA embedded in the AXI PCAP provides the master interface to the Device configuration block for any DMA transfers. The data transfer can take place between the Tx/RxFIFOs of AXI-PCAP and memory (on chip RAM/DDR/peripheral memory).<p>
The current driver only supports the downloading the FPGA bitstream and readback of the decrypted image (sort of loopback). The driver does not know what information needs to be written to the FPGA to readback FPGA configuration register or memory data. The application above the driver should take care of creating the data that needs to be downloaded to the FPGA so that the bitstream can be readback. This driver also does not support the reading of the internal registers of the PCAP. The driver has no knowledge of the PCAP internals.<p>
<b> Initialization and Configuration </b><p>
The device driver enables higher layer software (e.g., an application) to communicate with the Device Configuration device.<p>
<a class="el" href="xdevcfg_8c.html#b2d64917ea2509c03e055cf9b21f6cfe">XDcfg_CfgInitialize()</a> API is used to initialize the Device Configuration Interface. The user needs to first call the <a class="el" href="xdevcfg__sinit_8c.html#92c032362fd595179810039255a5b576">XDcfg_LookupConfig()</a> API which returns the Configuration structure pointer which is passed as a parameter to the <a class="el" href="xdevcfg_8c.html#b2d64917ea2509c03e055cf9b21f6cfe">XDcfg_CfgInitialize()</a> API.<p>
<b>Interrupts</b> The Driver implements an interrupt handler to support the interrupts provided by this interface.<p>
<b> Threads </b><p>
This driver is not thread safe. Any needs for threads or thread mutual exclusion must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.<p>
<b> Asserts </b><p>
Asserts are used within all Xilinx drivers to enforce constraints on argument values. Asserts can be turned off on a system-wide basis by defining, at compile time, the NDEBUG identifier. By default, asserts are turned on and it is recommended that users leave asserts on during development.<p>
<b> Building the driver </b><p>
The <a class="el" href="struct_x_dcfg.html">XDcfg</a> driver is composed of several source files. This allows the user to build and link only those parts of the driver that are necessary.<p>

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:</pre><p>
<pre> Ver   Who Date     Changes
 ----- --- -------- ---------------------------------------------
 1.00a hvm 02/07/11 First release
 2.00a nm  05/31/12 Updated the driver for CR 660835 so that input length for
		     source/destination to the XDcfg_InitiateDma, XDcfg_Transfer
		     APIs is words (32 bit) and not bytes.
 		     Updated the notes for XDcfg_InitiateDma/XDcfg_Transfer APIs
		     to add information that 2 LSBs of the Source/Destination
		     address when equal to 2’b01 indicate the last DMA command
		     of an overall transfer.
		     Destination Address passed to this API for secure transfers
		     instead of using 0xFFFFFFFF for CR 662197. This issue was
		     resulting in the failure of secure transfers of
		     non-bitstream images.
 2.01a nm  07/07/12 Updated the XDcfg_IntrClear function to directly
		     set the mask instead of oring it with the
		     value read from the interrupt status register
 		     Added defines for the PS Version bits,
	             removed the FIFO Flush bits from the
		     Miscellaneous Control Reg.
		     Added XDcfg_GetPsVersion, XDcfg_SelectIcapInterface
		     and XDcfg_SelectPcapInterface APIs for CR 643295
		     The user has to call the XDcfg_SelectIcapInterface API
		     for the PL reconfiguration using AXI HwIcap.
		     Updated the XDcfg_Transfer API to clear the
		     QUARTER_PCAP_RATE_EN bit in the control register for
		     non secure writes for CR 675543.
 2.02a nm  01/31/13 Fixed CR# 679335.
 		     Added Setting and Clearing the internal PCAP loopback.
		     Removed code for enabling/disabling AES engine as BootROM
		     locks down this setting.
		     Fixed CR# 681976.
		     Skip Checking the PCFG_INIT in case of non-secure DMA
		     loopback.
		     Fixed CR# 699558.
		     XDcfg_Transfer fails to transfer data in loopback mode.
		     Fixed CR# 701348.
                    Peripheral test fails with  Running
 		     DcfgSelfTestExample() in SECURE bootmode.
 2.03a nm  04/19/13 Fixed CR# 703728.
		     Updated the register definitions as per the latest TRM
		     version UG585 (v1.4) November 16, 2012.
 3.0   adk 10/12/13 Updated as per the New Tcl API's
 3.0   kpc 21/02/14 Added function prototype for XDcfg_ClearControlRegister
