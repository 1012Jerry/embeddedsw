 ----- ------ -------- ----------------------------------------------
 1.00	hbm    08/19/10 First Release
 1.01a nm     12/20/12 Added definition XDMAPS_CHANNELS_PER_DEV which specifies
		        the maximum number of channels.
		        Replaced the usage of XPAR_XDMAPS_CHANNELS_PER_DEV
                       with XDMAPS_CHANNELS_PER_DEV defined in <a class="el" href="xdmaps__hw_8h.html">xdmaps_hw.h</a>.
			Added the tcl file to automatically generate the
			xparameters.h
 1.02a sg     05/16/12 Made changes for doxygen and moved some function
			header from the xdmaps.h file to <a class="el" href="xdmaps_8c.html">xdmaps.c</a> file
			Other cleanup for coding guidelines and CR 657109
			and CR 657898
			The xdmaps_example_no_intr.c example is removed
			as it is using interrupts  and is similar to
			the interrupt example - CR 652477
 1.03a sg     07/16/2012 changed inline to __inline for CR665681
 1.04a nm     10/22/2012 Fixed CR# 681671.
 1.05a nm     04/15/2013 Fixed CR# 704396. Removed warnings when compiled
			  with -Wall and -Wextra option in bsp.
	       05/01/2013 Fixed CR# 700189. Changed XDmaPs_BuildDmaProg()
			  function description.
			  Fixed CR# 704396. Removed unused variables
			  UseM2MByte &amp; MemBurstLen from XDmaPs_BuildDmaProg()
			  function.
 1.07a asa    11/02/13. Made changes to fix compilation issues for iarcc.
			   Removed the PDBG prints. By default they were always
			   defined out and never used. The PDBG is non-standard for
			   Xilinx drivers and no other driver does something similar.
			   Since there is no easy way to fix compilation issues with
			   the IARCC compiler around PDBG, it is better to remove it.
			   Users can always use xil_printfs if they want to debug.
 2.0   adk    10/12/13  Updated as per the New Tcl API's
